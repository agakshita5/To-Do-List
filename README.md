<h3>What I built:</h3> 
You can add new tasks and tick them off your list.<br>
Completed tasks get a strikethrough to show they're done!<br>
<h3>What I learned:</h3>
Building this app helped me understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
I learned how to structure web pages, add styles, and make things interactive with code.
